# Sparks_payment_gateway_integration
A simple website where payment gateway is integrated. There is a simple donate button on the homepage. On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where the user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type. Once payment is done an invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received.
